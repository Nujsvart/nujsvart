Hello!
- I am a self-taught Frontend Developer with 3 years of experience in developing web applications using Html/CSS, JavaScript and React. 
- I'm currently learning TypeScript and Next.js to expand my skillset. 
- I'm highly passionate about programming and always strive to improve my skills. 

In addition to my passion for software development, I have a strong interest in continuous learning and self-improvement. I enjoy reading, particularly in the genres of fantasy and science-fiction novels, as it helps me to expand my mind and enrich my ideas. I also take pleasure in spending time in nature and engaging in sports. To unwind and relax, I enjoy playing computer games with a tactical and strategy focus during my leisure time.
